# Project_Cleanning_Data
El prop√≥sito de este proyecto es demostrar su capacidad para recopilar, trabajar y limpiar un conjunto de datos.

This graded project done by me contains all the answers to all five questions.

The run_analysis.R script contains the R code with the steps/ transformations/ ordering and cleaning performed on the data provided in detail.

In addition, a code book (CodeBook.txt) was shared that mentions the variables and data used in the project.

The 5 questions that were answered in this work were:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
